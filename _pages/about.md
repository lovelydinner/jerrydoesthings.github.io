I am a second-year PhD student at the Institute of Operations Research and Analytics, National University of Singapore. 

I am fortunate to be advised by [Melvyn Sim](https://discovery.nus.edu.sg/768-melvyn-sim) and [Ian Zhu](https://www.ianyzhu.com/) at the National University of Singapore, and [Ng Wee Siong](https://wsiong.github.io/) at the Institute for Infocomm Research, A*STAR.
Broadly speaking, my research interests are in data-driven optimization and incentive design. My methodological interests are in inverse and robust optimization, as well as the intersection of the two, with particular thematic interests in addressing real-world sustainability problems in logistics and transportation.

I am also thankful to be awarded the [A*STAR Computing and Information Science Scholarship](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/Scholarships/for-graduate-studies/a-star-cis-scholarship) which funds my PhD studies. Prior to my PhD, I completed my MSc. in Operations Research at the Department of Mathematics, London School of Economics, and a BEng. in Industrial Engineering at the National University of Singapore. 

Outside of academia, I greatly enjoy the outdoors and being active - some of my favourite activities include [dragonboating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_boat), hiking (which unfortunately is not as accessible in the tiny island of Singapore), and weightlifting. I also enjoy reading mangas and watching anime.
